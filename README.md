Specifications

1. Access all the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.

2. Click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.

3. Thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use https://picsum.photos/ as stylish placeholders.)

4. Navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

5. A link to https://www.altcademy.com on your website, makes most sense to put it at the footer. The text can be something like "Part of Altcademy's Fullstack Program".

Issues:
The bs navbar component was not toggling, and from copying the source code and seeing that did not work either, i concluded it was because my dependancies were missing a file import of some sort. I suspected it may be popper.js but ultimately after a while I came across the react-boostrap library and I'm pleased with the ease of use!
