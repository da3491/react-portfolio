Thanks for taking the time to check out my page!

I wanted to create something fairly minimalistic and esthetically pleasing. But also including the functionality of different themes for a bit of interactivity.

Althought I did start with Bootstrap, I didn't like how it crowded my components. So I decided to build out this project without any CSS framework, both to separate and centralize the location of my CSS, and to exercise my knowledge of properties and responsiveness.

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

Issues:
The bs navbar component was not toggling, and from copying the source code and seeing that did not work either, i concluded it was because my dependancies were missing a file import of some sort. I suspected it may be popper.js but ultimately after a while I came across the react-boostrap library and I'm pleased with the ease of use!
