# Portfolio

Thanks for taking the time to check out my page!

I wanted to create something fairly minimalistic and esthetically pleasing. But also including the functionality of different themes for a bit of interactivity.

Althought I did start with Bootstrap, I didn't like how it crowded my components. So I decided to build out this project without any CSS framework, both to separate and centralize the location of my CSS, and to exercise my knowledge of properties and responsiveness.
